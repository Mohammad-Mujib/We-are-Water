## Topic

Water is a very important element in our daily life. Without water we can't even move a single day. But unfortunately we are facing a global droughts. And it's very alarming for all of us. That's why we need to be much more cautous and responsible in the consumption of water. In my project I will analize the distribution, consumption and the storage of water of Comundad de Madrid as a part of public awareness.
 
 ## Technology stack ‚öô
 
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Excel
 - Google-sheet
 - Power BI
 
 ## Data Sources
 
 I have collected the data from:
 - Instituto Estad√≠stica de Comunidad de Madrid
 - Ayuntamiento de Madrid
 - Canal de Isabel II
 
 ## Procedure
 
 - Download the data from the sources
 - Most of my data was in .xls format and I used Excel/Google-sheet to clean them up
 - I also used Python/Pandas to clean and transform my data
 - Explore the data as much as possible
 - Save the cleaned data/tables in csv files
 
 ## Next steps ‚û°Ô∏è
 
 - Connect the csv files from Power BI Dekstop
 - Make changes/transform in power query if necessary
 - Look on the data model
 - Go building the spectacular dashboard
 
 ## Folder structure üìÅ
 
 - data 
 - cleaned-data
 - notebooks
 - wip(work in progress)
 - README.md
 - gitignore
 
 ## Output üì¨
 
 I have built an interactive dashboard. In my dashboard a user can find the information about all the reservoirs and their capacity of Comunidad de Madrid. Also the info about the deposits of water, evolution of consuming, elevation station, distribution and consumption per sector and the consumption of water of per habitants in per day. And I am hopeful that it will help us all to be more consious about the use and waste of water.
